            <h2 class="first_word">Despite </h2>
            <p style="display: inline;" class="lead"> having a strong bond with her colleagues, whom she considered as
                family, Alice
                encountered a disconcerting moment at Eric Wellman's holiday party. <span class="text-success">She
                    struggled to recall the identity
                    of Dan's wife, raising concerns about her own memory.</span> Determined to understand what was
                happening, Alice
                sought the expertise of Dr. Davis, who suspected an underlying issue with her memory. Despite the
                concerns raised, Alice found it difficult to accept that her memory was deteriorating. She clung to the
                hope that reviewing photo albums and meticulously recalling details would reassure her of her mental
                acuity.
            </p>
        </div>

        <p class="lead">However, as the month drew to a close, Alice's memory lapses became more pronounced. In a
            heartbreaking turn,
            <span class="text-success">she even forgot how to make Christmas pudding, a cherished tradition.</span> It
            was during this time that Lydia,
            her daughter, may have begun to notice that something was amiss with her mother's cognitive abilities.

        <p id="quote">For Alice her colleagues were more than colleagues. What did they do together and share? Why do
            you think that the author arranges this scenario into this month? </p>
        <p class="text-muted">Alice and her colleagues have a relationship akin to that of a family. They participate in
            each other's major
            life events, such as weddings, births, and the achievements of their children and grandchildren.
            Additionally, they support one another in their scientific research endeavors. They travel together to
            various parts of the world to attend conferences. They also provide mutual support in overcoming waves of
            crippling self-doubt, dealing with illness, and going through divorces.(p.57)</p>
        <p class="text-muted">However, due to Alzheimer's disease, I believe Alice will soon lose this "family" that she
            takes pride in and
            feels deeply involved with. At this point, she is unaware that her relationship with her colleagues is built
            on the premise of equality, as they engage in similar work and rely on each other. However, once someone is
            unable to maintain the same level of quality or ability, I believe this connection will be lost. I think the
            author has arranged this scene as a foreshadowing of Alice eventually leaving Harvard and her "family" at
            Harvard.</p>
        <p id="quote">What went wrong when Alice was preparing the ingredients for the bread pudding? What did Alice do
            to the eggs? What have you learned or noticed by reading “the massacre” of eggs?</p>
        <p class="text-muted">When Alice was preparing bread pudding, she realized that she had forgotten how to make
            the recipe she had
            known since childhood. She couldn't remember how many eggs to add, and even with her efforts to recall, she
            had absolutely no recollection. This incident made the repetitive recitation of various words to test her
            memory seem meaningless, as it directly proved Alice's memory issues.</p>
        <p class="text-muted">Here, I believe this portrays the
            clinical manifestation of Alzheimer's disease in patients. In the early stages of Alzheimer's, patients may
            still be able to remember deliberately learned things. This is because these activities involve shorter-term
            memory processes, which are associated with brain areas less affected, such as the hippocampus.
            Additionally, these learning activities may also involve more conscious and purposeful attention, allowing
            patients to better retain these memories in the short term.
        </p>
        <p class="text-muted">However, long-term memories, such as the recipe she had known since childhood, are greatly
            impacted.
            Long-term memories primarily involve the hippocampus and temporal lobe, which are often severely degenerated
            and damaged in Alzheimer's disease. As a result, patients may struggle to recall early personal experiences,
            childhood events, or specific details from long-term memory.</p>
